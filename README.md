The Movie Search App is a React-based application that allows users to log in as a Star Wars character and search for planets from the Star Wars universe. The app fetches data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API) and displays planets with dynamic sizing based on their population.

Features
Login Screen:

Users can log in using a Star Wars character's name as the username and their birth year as the password.
